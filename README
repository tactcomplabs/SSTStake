The SST "Stake" generator component directly fuses
the RISC-V "Spike" functional simulation infrastructure
to the memory infrastructure simulation capabilities
present in the SST parallel discrete event simulator
developed and distributed by Sandia National
Laboratories.  Stake permits users to compile
and execute binary applications in the Spike
simulator while dispatching each individual
memory request into the SST simulation infrastructure.
As a result, users have the ability to functionally
simulate arithmetic operations while simulating
memory operations with a cycle-based cadence.

Stake requires users to build and install
the SST and SST-Elements infrastructure using
the 8.0.0 release or master trees (see git link below).
